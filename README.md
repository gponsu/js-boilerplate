Boilerplate code for javascript katas
=====================================

This repository is a boilerplate code for using when we are going to start a new kata in javascript.

### Getting Started

In order to use it, we must install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) to run it with a container, or install a standard node development environment and run it in your local machine.

To run the project with docker, we can do the following:

    $ ./bin/start

Now, thanks to [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest), every time we save a change, we'll see how the tests run automatically at the terminal.
